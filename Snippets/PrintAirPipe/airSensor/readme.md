# PrintAirPipe - 125 Air Sensor Segment

Using the PrintAirPipe – 125 Air Sensor Segment for the PrintAirPipe system, it is possible to measure various properties of the air inside the pipe system.

For this purpose, a BME680, a BME280 and one of the available fermion gas sensors from DF-Robot can be installed inside.

The sensors can then be read using the SeeedStudio XIAO ESP32 S3 installed in the sensor segment. Thanks to the firmware based on the ESPHome Framework, the data can easily be forwarded to a SmartHome system or elsewhere and processed accordingly.

This means you can also react to certain values. For example, after detecting a certain change in air quality, the supply air path could be shut off. The PrintAirPipe – ServoValve available here can be used for this purpose.
