# PrintAirPipe - 125 Servo Valve - 3D printable

With the PrintAirPipe servo valve, the air flow in the pipe run of the PrintAirPipe system can be blocked or regulated. This is practical if, for example, you want to shut off a supply air or exhaust air path.

The control is implemented via an MG90 servo and an ESP32 board. Both are installed on the tube segment and supplied with energy via a USB-C connection. The firmware of the ESp32 is based on ESPHome and can therefore be easily integrated into Home Assistant or other SmartHome systems.

The valve can then be closed, opened or partially opened or closed from the SmartHome system.

Using a touch switch installed on the unit, the valve status can also be switched between open and closed directly on the unit. The current status of the valve is displayed via an LED on the unit.
