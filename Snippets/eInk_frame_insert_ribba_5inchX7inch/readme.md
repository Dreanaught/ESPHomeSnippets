The more you get into the topic of SmartHome, the more you ask yourself how you can bring all this data into your normal life in the most convenient and attractive way possible.

One solution to this problem is my MagicMirror project. I have another one thanks to Madalena (https://github.com/Madelena) when I came across your GitHub repo a few months ago (https://github.com/Madelena/esphome-weatherman-dashboard). 

After expanding the project a bit, I came up with the E-Ink frame insert shown below, which can be used to build a battery-powered E-Ink display that receives the data from a Home Assistant instance.

To simplify the hardware setup a bit, I created a 3D printable insert with which the E-Ink display and the complete electronics can be installed precisely in the Ikea Ribba 5″x7″ frame used.

The STL files are available [here](https://nerdiy.de/en/product-2/eink-frame-insert-suitable-for-ikea-ribba-5x7-picture-frame-3d-printable-stl-files/).
